# IT-Uppsala-Exams
A collection of all exams from the Master's Programme in Computer and Information Engineering.
The collection consists of two parts:
* Tentor IT (No sol) – The latest five exams (as of 2024) for each IT course, note that these do not come with a solution. The exams are for the most part seperated by course folders including course ID and name. 
* Year folders – These contain exams organized by year, with their corresponding courses attached. They originate from a long history of previously shared folders.

If you have additional exams or would like to suggest changes, feel free to submit a pull request or send me the files.
